## Challenges we ran into
We face issues with Google Colab working on the same file, having bugs at loading the packages.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are able to display the database on several groupings.
## What we learned
We learn how to use Google Colab and working in a team.
## What's next for 1000 GENOMES - Data Analysis
Using more of the dataset available and working with anthropologists.
